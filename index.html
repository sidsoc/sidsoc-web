                  We at the Student Innovation and Development Society believe in giving students the ultimate advantage when it comes to securing that all-important much-coveted job! Our society was set up in 2014 in order to promote innovation and professional development by providing NCI students across all disciplines the opportunity to engage in projects outside of their academic studies. Our aim is that students build professional experience and develop their technical skills whilst operating in a real world environment.

In his short time in NCI, Wayne has achieved high grades amongst his peers and won the NCI Dean’s Award for Entrepreneurship last year. He is currently working as a Software Developer at Groupon.

This once proud owner of a Tandy TRS-80 this year decided to formalise his wealth of knowledge by undertaking the BSc. (Hons) in Computing. We have no doubt that this maths-loving Jamaican native will do great things during his time at NCI.
