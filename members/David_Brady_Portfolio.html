                                    <p>
                                        EventHawk is a mobile web application which combines a userâ€™s current geo location with a live database of events and several APIs and web technologies to provide them with a personalised view of events and activities in their area. This application was built for a software project during my second year of my degree in Computing at National College of Ireland (NCI). The goal of this project was to build a Mashable Web application, combing available APIs and technologies in order to create a new or improved product. The success of this project led me and my team to earning the highest project grade that year (92%).

                                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Due to the large scale of the project, each team member was assigned a number of duties or roles in areas that we each felt were of interest to us while also providing us with a motivating challenge. As we had never taken on a project of this size and complexity before, a great amount of self-learning was required by each member in order to carry out our respective roles.
                                    <p>
                                    <h4>Project Manager</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Each project team was required to elect one member as the Project Manager. Due to my interest in the area of IT Project Management and previous success running project teams within both the academic and professional environment, my team elected me as Project Manager. In this role, I managed all aspects of the project from the documentation such as requirements specification documents and various presentations to assigning roles and measurable tasks to each team member and facilitating regular meetings and scrum sessions. I used Google Docs software to set up a multi-user project environment on Google Drive where each team member could upload and share their work allowing us all to work and communicate remotely with great success. The project was successfully delivered within time and scope.

                                    <h4>UI/UX Designer</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        My technical role on this project was the User Interface/User Experience Designer. It was my duty to design the look and feel of the application. It was essential that the application be compatible and provide the same user experience across multiple devices and browsers, both desktop and mobile. I wanted the application to have a native feel without having to write the application for native platforms. I used the JQuery Mobile framework to build an interface that was responsive and allowed the same functionality no matter which device was being used. I designed the interface in such a way so as to ensure that everything the user needs is only 3 clicks/taps away at the most.

                                        Secure Network Solutions is the name of the business which my fellow teammates and I created as part of our Business Entrepreneurship module in the second year of my Computing degree. As part of this module, we were tasked with creating an innovative business product and constructing a business plan which could be used in order to achieve financial backing for the project. The business plan earned one of the highest grades out of all participating team projects across both the School of Business and the School of Computing and which resulted in our team being shortlisted for the prestigious NCI Dean's Award finals. The Secure Network Solutions team went on to successfully win the NCI Dean's Award in May 2014.<p>
                                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        My role on this project was to devise the marketing section of the plan. This consisted of: market overview and trend analysis, competitor analysis, customer segmentation, SWOT analysis and marketing strategy.
                                    <p>
                                    <h3>The Concept (The SNS-1)</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The concept behind Secure Network Solutions was to provide a hardware device that would house anti-virus software and would reside between the user's ISP source and their network router. The idea is that this would allow for data to be filtered at source so that any data propagated from the router would be secure. This would then eliminate the need for individual anti-virus licences on individual devices connected to the network.
                                    <p>

                                        This project made up the technical requirement of my third year module in Artificial Intellegence. I was tasked with building a working chess application in Java with a graphical representation of a chess board complete with moving pieces. The project also required me to build a logic engine with three levels of difficulty as well as two game modes (Human Vs AI and AI Vs AI)
                                    <p>
                                    <h3>My Role</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        This was a solo project and due to complexity of the task I utilised available tutorials in order to get the working board and pieces represented on screen (Code is fully referenced throughout). 
                                        I developed the logic engine for both the "Random" and "Aggressive" opponent agents, I also developed the dual game modes.

The document includes a number of software engineering diagrams such as Context Diagrams, Data Flow Diagrams, Entity Relationship Diagrams, Normalisation, Use Case Diagrams, Use Cases and Conceptual Class Diagrams.
